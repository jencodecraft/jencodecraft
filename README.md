## Hi, I'm Jennifer 
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Python and JavaScript

ðŸŒ± Have a look at some of my FreeCodeCamp projects on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/collection/AawxBy)

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding I enjoy photography and playing around with abstract compositions. The photo at the top of this page is a recoloured close up of one of the walls at the top of the Oslo Opera House.
